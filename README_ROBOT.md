use wurth elektronik 61200323021 for connectors to servoes?

use extra tall connector to get more space when mounted board to board?

samtec tsm-150-01-t-sv if cabled instead of board

samtec esq or esw look reasonalbe but maybe not surface mount


fix rev 1.x

extend lga pads outside chip

move chip select 0 to left side of board (near chip 0)

use power 2 properly



on eric's notes I started going to a golbal enable, but I didn't remove the signals from the pi headder or renams
